# 2016 Hubsan X4 H107C+ Review #
The Hubsan X4 H107C Plus is Hubsan's latest version of their top selling drone. It's a 720P, Ready To Fly (RTF) Camera Drone.

## The Best Drone For Beginners ##
The Hubsan X4 H107C Plus is one of the easiest drones to fly. With two flight modes, **Easy** and **Advanced**, the drone caters to both **beginner drone pilots** as well as those who have been flying for a while.

The improved 6 Axis Gyro really has increased the stability of the drone, and it's easy to anticipate the drone movement, even at higher speeds.

The Drone can easily do flips, barrel rolls and other stunts in advanced mode, so flying is really fun.

You'll get an improved 7-10 minutes of flight time with the Hubsan X4 H107C plus, which is about three minutes more over it's predecessor.
