# DJI Phantom 3 Standard Review with Lower Price #

It's been a few weeks since the DJI Phantom 4 has been released, but DJI enthusiasts rejoice:

### The DJI Phantom 3 Standard Has A Lower Price! ###

The **Phantom 3** is the perfect drone for just about anyone. It's super easy to fly, yet has all the advanced features that you'd expect from a DJI drone. 

The **Onboard 2.7K Camera** is mounted to a gimbal for the smoothest video and crispest still images, and with it's tilt feature that you control from the controller, **you can always get the shot you want.**

The DJI Phantom 3 **hovers just after takeoff** to allow you time to figure out where you will be sending the drone. This helps to minimize *"drone flyoff"*, or when a beginner mashes the throttle joystick and the drone shoots off like a bat out of hell into a tree or something.

The Phantom 3 also has a nice **"Return To Home"** feature. The GPS remembers where the drone took off from, and when the return to home feature is activated, **the Phantom 3 returns to the takeoff coordinates and lands itself**.

There are many more features, but for that, you'll have to read the full review:
